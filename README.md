## About

This project bridges **computational thinking** with **compassionate action** — demonstrating how classical AI algorithms can serve humanitarian purposes.

Built as a capstone project for CS4: Introduction to AI at Las Positas College, the game draws from 16 years of volunteer coordination experience with Tzu Chi Foundation in Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco.

## The Question This Project Asks

> *"If I give you three hours of my limited monthly availability, will you coordinate those hours well enough to create genuine impact?"*

## The Seven Levels

| Level | Algorithm | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **A* Search** | Finding the best path to deliver meals to elderly neighbors |
| 2 | **Propositional Logic** | Making fair decisions about who receives resources |
| 3 | **MDP** | Planning actions when outcomes are uncertain |
| 4 | **Knowledge-Based Agent** | Exploring new communities safely and respectfully |
| 5 | **Bayesian Networks** | Understanding what keeps volunteers engaged |
| 6 | **First-Order Logic** | Matching the right people to the right tasks |
| 7 | **Alpha-Beta Pruning** | Facing ethical dilemmas with wisdom, not just calculation |

## Design Philosophy

**Ataraxy Portico (靜心之門)** — Between each level, players pause for breath and reflection with Jing Si Aphorisms:

「動中有靜，靜中有動」  
*Within motion, find stillness; within stillness, find motion.*

## Acknowledgments

**Professor An Lam** — For introducing algorithms I never imagined I could understand. Your patience with a returning student has been extraordinary.

**Roxanne Buchwitz 黃淑雲師姊** — My mentor of sixteen years. The handful of raw rice you witnessed at John Muir Elementary in 2006 became the seed of all this.

**Sacramento Tzu Chi Volunteers Chou & Joe** — Who drove my family home from UC Davis Medical Center after my 2015 surgery, though we had never met. We were strangers connected only as Tzu Chi dharma family (法親).

**My Daughter** — Who donated her kidney to me and believes her mother can do anything. I'm trying.

**The Families of Hunters Point** — This work is for you.

**All Tzu Chi Dharma Family (法親)** — For walking this path together.
