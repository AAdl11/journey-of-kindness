# Journey of Kindness - Development Timeline

This document records the authentic development journey of the Journey of Kindness project. As a 58-year-old student returning to school, I constantly balanced volunteer service, family responsibilities, and CS4 coursework. This was not a straight path, but every step was real.

## 📅 Complete Timeline

### 🎯 August 2025: A New Beginning

#### August 10 (Sunday) — First Window
**A New Chapter After Resignation**

Before the semester started, I had already resigned from my job to focus fully on my studies. That evening, I excitedly attempted to write my first Python window program.

```
9:30pm — Opened VS Code, palms slightly sweating
11:30pm — Finally saw a small window appear!
Feeling: So excited! This is what I want to learn!
```

**Technical Milestone:** Completed first Pygame window display

---

#### August 19 (Tuesday) — First Day of School
**Professor Lam's Story**

First day of school, I met our new professor, Professor An Lam. He is a Vietnamese refugee who shared his struggle story to encourage us students.

After hearing his story, my heart was deeply moved. It reminded me of 2004 when I first came to America as an international student — my landlord was also a Vietnamese refugee who later became a pioneer engineer at Cisco Systems.

Professor Lam's story showed me: a refugee can become a professor. A 58-year-old like me can also learn AI.

---

#### August 22-24 (Friday-Sunday) — Portland Social Media Retreat
**Tzu Chi Social Media Training**

Flew to Portland for the Tzu Chi national social media retreat.

```
Skills learned:
✅ Professional social media post creation
✅ Tzu Chi brand visual design
✅ Content scheduling and engagement strategies
```

**Cost:** Python completely neglected. First week coursework left behind.

### 🍂 September 2025: Juggling Multiple Responsibilities

#### September 6 (Saturday) — Headquarters Care Team MC
**TCSF 總會核心關懷 - E.P.I.C. Framework**

Tzu Chi USA Headquarters sent a care team to visit San Francisco branch. I served as MC and facilitated the discussion section: **"Using Multimedia and Game Interaction to Attract and Guide New Bodhisattvas"** (以多媒體與遊戲互動，吸引並接引新菩薩).

This presentation introduced the E.P.I.C. (Education, Philosophy, Innovation, Collaboration) framework that became the foundation for Journey of Kindness.

```
Preparation: Spent one full week combining AI with Tzu Chi philosophy
Result: Successfully presented to visiting headquarters leadership
Impact: This became the seed for Journey of Kindness project
4:15am — Finally finished preparing all materials
```

#### September 14 (Saturday) — Northwest Kidney Gathering
**Sharing Personal Transplant Story**

Northwest Region Tzu Chi Kidney Support Group bi-monthly gathering. As a living donor kidney recipient, I shared my personal experience to encourage fellow kidney patients on how to care for body, mind, and spirit.

```
Topic: Living kidney donation — my daughter's gift
Audience: Fellow kidney patients and caregivers
Feeling: Cried while sharing, but felt it was meaningful
```

#### October 21 (Monday) — Midterm Exam 期中考
**A Wake-Up Call 當頭棒喝**

The exam did not go well at all. I knew immediately — I had been spreading myself too thin.

I wrote a letter to Professor Lam, confessing my struggles: trying to balance Tzu Chi volunteer work, family responsibilities, Honors Program, DxD interview preparation, and CS4 coursework.

His response (October 23) was brief but powerful:

> "You need to set your priorities straight and commit to whatever you consider the most important items on your list. **Programming is not rocket science, it's a matter of how much time you spend on it.**"

A wake-up call. 當頭棒喝.

From this day forward, I committed to genuine learning over shortcuts.

---

#### October 22 (Wednesday) — A* Finally Works!
**Major Technical Breakthrough**

```
After Honors Meeting ended
A* Search algorithm finally worked!

Thinking about how this algorithm could help Tzu Chi volunteers
Find the shortest delivery route in Hunters Point community
Save 15 minutes of time
I couldn't help but cry

Those 15 minutes might be the difference between
A hungry family getting food in time or not
```

**Technical Milestone:** Level 1 A* Search completed

---

#### October 31 (Thursday) — DxD First Interview
**Stanford DxD Health Technology Pathway**

```
Interview topic: Why do you want to join the health technology field?

My answer:
As a kidney transplant recipient, I understand the suffering of lifelong medication.
I want to use AI technology to develop new treatments
To help more kidney disease patients like myself.
```

---

### 🍁 November 2025: Sprint to Completion

#### November 3 (Sunday) — Ataraxy Portico Completed
**DxD Second Interview + Technical Breakthrough**

```
After DxD interview ended
3:15am — Finally finished the "Ataraxy Portico" (靜心之門) breathing circle

This feature allows players to pause, breathe, find inner peace
Just like what Tzu Chi taught me about quiet reflection
```

**Technical Milestone:** Meditation breathing feature completed

---

#### November 14 (Thursday) — DxD Results
**A Relief and New Focus**

```
Received notification: I was not selected.

Although disappointed, honestly... I felt relieved.
Now I can fully commit to Journey of Kindness.

DxD didn't select me, but this path won't stop.
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

**Professor An Lam** — For teaching me that "programming is not rocket science, it's a matter of how much time you spend on it."

**Sister Roxanne (黃淑雲師姊)** — For 16 years of guidance in Tzu Chi service, and for the story of the little girl eating raw rice that started it all.

**My Daughter** — Who donated her kidney to me and believes her mother can do anything.

**The Hunters Point Community** — For trusting Tzu Chi with their stories and needs.

---

## 💭 Final Reflection

Returning to school at 58, I originally thought I would be the slowest student in class.

But Professor Lam's story told me: a refugee can become a professor.
Sister Roxanne's story told me: witnessing suffering can transform into 16 years of action.
My kidney transplant experience told me: technology and love can change lives.

Journey of Kindness is not just a CS4 final project.
It is the crystallization of my 58 years of life experience, 16 years of Tzu Chi service, and one semester of AI learning.
It is my initial aspiration to speak for kidney patients and recruit volunteers for Tzu Chi.

Gratitude to everyone who has helped me.
This code is dedicated to you.
